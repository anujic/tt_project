# Morse Code Trainer

An interactive educational game that teaches Morse code through hands-on practice with a 7-segment display and tactile input.

# How it works

This Morse Code trainer presents letters on a 7-segment display and challenges users to input the correct Morse code pattern using a telegraph key. The system provides immediate feedback and progresses through a carefully selected set of characters.

### Game Flow
1. **Character Display**: Shows a letter on the 7-segment display
2. **Input Phase**: User inputs Morse code using the telegraph key
   - Short press = Dot (.)  
   - Long press = Dash (-)
3. **Validation**: System checks input against expected pattern
4. **Feedback**: Shows "C" for correct, "u" for wrong
5. **Progress**: Automatically moves to next character

### Learning Progression
The trainer starts with the most common and simple Morse characters:
- **E** (.) - Single dot
- **T** (-) - Single dash  
- **I** (..) - Two dots
- **A** (.-) - Dot dash
- **N** (-.) - Dash dot
- **M** (--) - Two dashes
- **S** (...) - Three dots
- **U** (..-) - Dot dot dash

## How to test

The design can be tested in simulation or on hardware:

### Simulation Testing
1. Run the provided cocotb testbench
2. Observe state transitions and timing behavior
3. Verify correct morse pattern recognition
4. Test button debouncing and edge cases

### Hardware Testing
1. Connect 7-segment display to `uo[6:0]`
2. Connect status LED to `uo[7]` 
3. Connect telegraph key to `ui[0]`
4. Connect navigation buttons to `ui[1]` and `ui[2]`
5. Power on and follow the learning sequence

## External hardware

### Required Components
- **7-Segment Display**: Common cathode, connected to `uo[6:0]`
- **Status LED**: Connected to `uo[7]` with current limiting resistor
- **Telegraph Key/Button**: Momentary switch connected to `ui[0]`
- **Next Button**: Momentary switch connected to `ui[1]` 
- **Reset Button**: Momentary switch connected to `ui[2]`

### Optional Enhancements  
- **Buzzer**: For audio feedback (requires additional output pin)
- **Pull-up Resistors**: For reliable button operation (10kÎ© recommended)
- **LED Indicators**: Additional status LEDs for game state visualization

### Pin Configuration
```
ui[0] - Morse Key Input (active high)
ui[1] - Next/Advance Button (active high) 
ui[2] - Reset Button (active high)
uo[6:0] - 7-Segment Display (A-G segments)
uo[7] - Status LED (correct/incorrect feedback)
```
